        <p class="mt-2">Mercury is the first planet in our Solar System, and it is also the smallest planet in our Solar System. It is named after
        the greek god. Because it has almost no atmosphere to retain heat, its temperatures on its surface ranges from -280 degrees F
        during the night to 700 degrees F during the day.
